# A* Pathfinding Visualizer 🌟

Designed and programmed an A* Pathfinding Visualizer in Python using the Pygame library. Assembled an interactive grid where users can draw walls 🧱, optimized for real-time updates 🚀, and computed the shortest path dynamically 🌍.

## Features 🛠️

- Interactive grid where you can draw start 🏁, end 🏁, and walls 🧱.
- Real-time updates for a smooth user experience 🚀.
- A* algorithm for finding the shortest path 🗺️.

## How to Start 🚀
1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Run "Pathfinding Visualizer.exe"**
3. **Interact with the grid:**

- Use the **Left Mouse button** to:
  - Set the **Start** and **End** points.
  - Draw **Walls** to define obstacles.
- Press the **Spacebar** to initiate the algorithm and find the shortest path.
- Press **C** to clear the grid and start over.
